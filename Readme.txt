Vickrey Auction code is written in the C programming language.

The input is a text file which contains numbers only separated by space or return.

Every consecutive number belongs to the same bidder for x number of items. 
Then the bids for the next bidder start
While running the program one needs to enter only the number of items and the number of bidders.

There is no bidder name only bidder numbers.

The input text file and the program need to be in the same directory.
